A grid consists of a range of buy and sell orders wherein a position is entered, and doubled down on as the price moves against the trade. This is known as the Martingale Strategy and is a key factor in the underlying approach.Dollar cost averaging into the position averages out the breakeven price closer to the mark price, and when the market rebounds or pulls back, limit “reduce” orders are used to slowly scale out of your position at the average mark price within your take profit range. Grid trading essentially trades volatility in arbitrary ranges set by a certain risk tolerance, margin balance, and aggression coefficient. As such, they can operate fairly quickly, executing order changes up to once per-second and sometimes filling orders even faster.'
